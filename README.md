# Real-Time-Object-Detection
PyTorch and OpenCV based application to perform real time  object detection

I built this as part of my learning effort to understand object detection algorithms and implement one of them.

## Usage
You can install all the used packages using.
 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To parse an URL.

```python Object_Detection_YouTube.py <URL> <Output_Filename.avi>```

## Upcoming Features.
<ul>
    <li>Real Time Object Detection using Webcam.</li>
    <li>Flask based REST API to stream parsed video live on web browser</li>
</ul>
